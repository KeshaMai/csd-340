</h1>
<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>Hello! My name is Jessica. I'm new to the coding world outside of html. Or so I thought! I'm learning that I may have forgotten some of the html coding style. I think so far I've really enjoed learning MySQL and html. The other code languages I'm still working towards understanding their form and how to build it properly.</p>

<p>Outside of school work, I work full time in a photo studio as an Equipment Manager. Every day is different and sometimes hard work but I like to keep busy. Sometime I make time to explore my own style of Photography, which is usally in studio work either food or model photography. I do some underwater photos when I go on scuba trips.</p>

<p>Some other hobbies I explore is camping, hiking, gym stuff. I like to keep an active lifestlye going and try to learn new skills. During the winter I will pick up indoor climbing again to keep busy. If we get enough snow here then I will most likely snowshoe, but that hasn't happened for the last two years sadly. 
</p>

<p>I'm excited to keep learning and growing with this Software Dev. program. I think it's exciting to think of a career shift or a whole new career if I can figure it out enough.
